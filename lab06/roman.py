"""
[06.2.2] Roman Numbers. Write a program that converts a Roman numeral, such as MCMLXXVIII, into its decimal representation. Tip: First, write a function that returns the numeric value of each individual letter, then use the following algorithm:

total = 0
s = string corresponding to the Roman numeral
Until s is empty
   If s has length 1, or the value of its first character is greater than or equal to the value of its second character
      Add the value of the first character of s to the total
      Remove the first character from s
   Otherwise
      difference = (value of the second character of s) â€“ (value of the first character of s)
      Add the difference value to the total
      Remove the first two characters from s
